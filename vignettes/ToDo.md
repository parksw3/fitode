\djde{The strict seasonality in Baca\"er's Figure 2 is very
 compelling.  This could happen from demographic stochasticity
 sustaining transients, but only if the damping period happens to be
 exactly one year.  I don't know if we can constrain the parameters
 sufficiently to rule that out (and we would need vital dynamics
 and/or decay of immunity to even try), but an exactly annual period
 is much more likely to arise from seasonal forcing.  Digging into
 this seems like a rabbit hole that is well outside the intended
 scope of this paper; it would certainly have to involve fitting all
 15 annual epidemics that Baca\"er shows and figuring out what other
 useful information is in all those reports that he cites.  But it
 would be fun to investigate, perhaps in another paper.}
\swp{Definitely another paper...}
